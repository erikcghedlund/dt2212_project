I wanna be the very best
Like no one ever was
To catch them is my real test
To train them is my cause
I will travel across the land
Searching far and wide
Teach Pokémon to understand
The power that's inside

Pokémon
Gotta catch 'em all It's you and me
I know it's my destiny Pokémon
Oh, you're my best friend
In a world we must defend Pokémon
Gotta catch 'em all A heart so true
Our courage will pull us through
You teach me and I'll teach you Ooh, ooh
Pokémon! Gotta catch 'em all
Gotta catch 'em all
Yeah
